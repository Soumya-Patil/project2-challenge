# Coding Approach :
- 	We chose a relational DBMS , Postgres as our Database because the data  was mainly read in as tables (CSVs , JSONs- geoJSON and topoJSON) , and thus it was easier to pre-define schema ;  Postgres seemed  best fit. 
- Python’s Pandas was used to clean the dataset .
-	HTML and CSS’s Bootstrap  were used to create and layout the webpage 
-	Javascript’s D3.js library was used to interact with the DOM elements and create dashboard
-	A flask app in Python was used to serve the webpages
- And finally it was deployed on Github.
